## Team Members and Roles

**Team Members:** Ado, Emily, Estrella, Lou, Jen, Josh


### Roles

**Product Owner: Ado** 
**Scrum master: Estrella**    
**Vibes watcher: Josh**   
**Git manager: Jen**    
**FE Lead: Lou**   
**BE Lead: Jen** 


## Teamwork principles

### Decision making
*How will you make decisions together*
- One person has that final say, product owner - Ado 
- If want to push ourselves with new tech, everyone has to agree
- Stand-ups within seperate teams  (set times) (front-end, back-end, if we choose to do so) 
- Voting system, if not decision was unable to be made by voting, (50/50) product owner (Ado) makes final decision. 
- One standup in the morning (9am), one before lunch (11:45), end of the day (4:30). Naturally works with break points. 

### Feedback 
*How / when will you give each other feedback during the project**
- Feedbacking one to one - address it rather than let it simmer. Not let it fester. Pull them to one side, communicate on what happened and your feelings. If you can’t resolve it by yourself bring in a facilitator. Also ask someone if they want your feedback as well, as some will be open to feedback, and sometimes you may not want to hear it.
- If feedback is not urgent, save till the end of the day 
- Standup round 
- Retros feedbacking on the day  
- No set time, if you have feedback to give, ask the person if they want to receive feedback at that time. 



### General principles
*How will you ensure that everyone in your team has an opportunity to feel included and contribute effectively*
- Making sure we are not talking to fast 
- Ensuring that everyone is heard and  understood
- If there is something in particular you are keen to do, talk to the group about. Be transparent by actively checking in with others and communicating issues 
- Everyone has at least one minute to have something to say in standups. 
- Process over product 
- If your not happy in what you’re doing, say something. - open communication
- Don’t struggle for longer than 10-15 minutes, the more frustrated you get, it will ruin the mood. 


### Communication
*What routines will you put in place to ensure consistent communication between team members*
- Each person has one minute to talk in stand-ups 
- First, how are you doing
- Second, what are you unto, or where are you unto - More expanded for the retro. 
- Making sure we are talking in the slack as well if something happens. 


### Conflicts
*How will you use Non Violent Communication (NVC) techniques*
- Considering feelings
- Objectively state the facts
- See where they are coming from 
- Don’t make emotionally charged comments. 
- Be open, honest and transparent
- If there is conflict that arises, take time away, before reacting in the moment. (Tell that person that you feel uncomfortable before you leave though) 
- Then going through points, and approach the situation. 

*How will you incorporate regular (wellbeing) check-ins? When and how will you do this*
- Stand of our stand-ups, and check ins. Checking in to see how everyone is feeling. And that way you know someone is not just being an ass they just don’t feel well. 


### Schedule 

*When will you schedule breaks*

Scheduled breaks: 
12 - 2 

What days will you work, and what days will you take a break?	 
Times coming in:
- Estrella 9-5
- Jen 9-5
- Ado 9-5
- Josh 9-5
- Lou 9-5
- Emily 9-5
Along as it doesn’t impact other people, can work outside of those hours. Structural stuff, don’t touch. 
Weekend is off, but if people choose to come in that’s fine. Unless MVP not achieved. Let people know if you’re not coming in. 


### Wellbeing
*How will you share your wellbeing needs with each other*
- Stress profile
- If something changes, super urgent, rally everyone. But pop in the slack if you can’t come in. Or even if you just need to go out for a walk chuck it in the slack. 
- That way we don’t leave people in the dark. And we can be more on that persons side. 
- In terms of being stressed, vocalise it to someone 


**Josh:**
- Stress: Quiter, swear under breath, seems like haven’t made any headway on a ticket sign,  getting tunnel vision and stress
- What we can do to help: Josh will ask for help from a facilitator, taking time out (water, fresh air). someone else to talk to  about how they are struggling. 

**Lou:**
- Stress: Short with people, hurried, 
- What we can do to help: Plan and organised, have structure, entertain the idea of creating a plan with me, can we make a plan to make a plan Just needs a moment or a walk

**Jen:**
- Stress: Tunnel vision, separating self, trying to get into  it
- What can we do to help: Ask for help, little break, change what you’re doing, eat something 

**Estrella:**
- Stress: Short, isolate myself, 
- What can we do to help: Get a hot choccie as a break

**Ado:** 
- Stress: Panic, (rushing, not really careful with making decision), stay inside head, fasting (morning will be fine, afternoon head doesn’t work (get headache))
- What can we do to telp: Not making decision a lot, tell you what to do. 

**Emily:**
- Stress: Shut down, face goes stone, remove myself (or need to remove myself) need a breather. 
- What can we do to help: Just check in if i’m alright. Talking things out, get off chest, push to side and let it go. 



How will we survive? 
- We don’t need to force eating together. We take our break at the same time, but can choose how we spend that time. 
- If you see someone has done something that doesn’t work, tell that person (I don’t feel like we are doing it right, can we talk about it) 
- Fun: balancing stressful, go for a walk, set aside a morning tea time to just talk and bring us together as a group. Take a break from tech and do something together, even if it’s a little cringey.
